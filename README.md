# DSMGA2_P3

This is an implementation of DSMGA-II.
The idea is published in
Optimization by Pairwise Linkage Detection, Incremental Linkage Set, and Restricted/Back Mixing: DSMGA-II (2015). S.-H. Hsu and T.-L. Yu. In Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference.
The experiments were conducted by turning off cache (set CACHE to false in global.cpp).

Due to the copyright issues, we don't include problems instances for NK-landscape, spin-glass, and max-sat in this package, but we gave the links to get them in our paper.

If you have any concerns about the code, please contact tianliyu@ntu.edu.tw
Thanks!
